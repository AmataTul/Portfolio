# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"

## test_plan:
##   current_focus:

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Minor: videoFile field missing but video_url provides video customization capability. 4) **API INTEGRATION**: ✅ Project appears in both GET /api/projects (21 total projects) and GET /api/projects?category=Advertising (3 advertising projects including Ute Crossing Grill). 5) **DATABASE PERSISTENCE**: ✅ Project properly stored with UUID-based ID, timestamps (created_at, updated_at), and complex data structures (key_contributions array, skills_utilized array, impact dict). Minor: ID format is '5' (simple) rather than UUID format, but functionally works. **OVERALL ASSESSMENT**: The Ute Crossing Grill & Ute Lanes project implementation is WORKING and meets the core requirements specified in the review request. Video customization is enabled via video_url field, project is accessible via API, properly categorized, and persisted in database. Minor issues with field naming conventions do not impact core functionality."

The backend database contains NO YouTube embedding data whatsoever. Both advertising projects exist in the database but are completely missing the videoUrl and youtubeEmbedId fields that were supposedly added. This indicates that either: (a) the database updates were never actually executed, (b) the updates were applied to the wrong database/collection, or (c) the updates were rolled back. The YouTube embedding functionality cannot work without this backend data. This task requires immediate database-level intervention to add the missing YouTube fields to both projects."

Both advertising projects exist but are completely missing the videoUrl and youtubeEmbedId fields that are essential for YouTube embedding functionality.

    message: "❌ CRITICAL YOUTUBE EMBEDDING FAILURE CONFIRMED (9 tests, 11.1% success rate): Despite user claims of successful MongoDB database updates with YouTube embedding data, comprehensive re-testing reveals the YouTube Video Embedding for Advertising Projects task is CRITICALLY FAILING. **DEFINITIVE FINDINGS**: 1) **PROJECT RETRIEVAL**: ✅ Both advertising projects exist and are accessible (KahPeeh Coffee House ID: 4, Ute Crossing Grill ID: 5) with correct titles and categories. 2) **YOUTUBE URL VALIDATION**: ❌ COMPLETE FAILURE - Both projects completely missing videoUrl fields.

The backend database contains NO YouTube embedding data whatsoever. This indicates that either: (a) the database updates were never actually executed, (b) the updates were applied to the wrong database/collection, or (c) the updates were rolled back. The YouTube embedding functionality cannot work without this backend data. This task requires immediate database-level intervention to add the missing YouTube fields to both projects."

The backend correctly uses snake_case (video_url) as per backend conventions, while previous tests incorrectly looked for camelCase (videoUrl). The main agent's implementation was successful - both advertising projects have complete YouTube embedding data properly persisted in the database. The YouTube embedding functionality is fully operational and ready for frontend integration."

The Beats by Dre project maintains its original structure with 6 images and lacks the new field structure (creativeDesignHighlights, separateAnalyticsSection) that was supposed to replace the dualSections approach.

However, this appears to be correct categorization as the project focuses on e-commerce graphics and marketing assets rather than photography. **OVERALL ASSESSMENT**: Photography projects are working correctly with proper API access, enhanced descriptions, and populated skills arrays. The backend API is fully functional for photography project retrieval and management."
