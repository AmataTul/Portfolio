    key_audit_findings: [
      "Disney's true competitive advantage lies in their 'ecosystem approach' - theme parks drive Disney+ subscriptions, which boost merchandise sales, creating a self-reinforcing cycle",
      "The company targets three generations simultaneously: nostalgic millennials (childhood memories), Gen X parents (family experiences), and Gen Z (social media content)",  
      "Disney+ became their marketing command center, not just a streaming service - every show launches tie-in merchandise, theme park attractions, and social campaigns",
      "Their pricing strategy defies logic but works: premium prices feel justified because Disney sells 'childhood magic' and 'family memories,' not entertainment",
      "Social media strategy is genius - they let visitors create content for them. Theme park guests become unpaid brand ambassadors posting millions of photos yearly"
    ],
    strategic_recommendations: [
      "Leverage Disney+ viewing data to create hyper-personalized merchandise recommendations - if someone watches Encanto 10 times, show them Mirabel products immediately",
      "Integrate social commerce into Instagram and TikTok - when Disney content goes viral, capitalize instantly with 'shop now' buttons on trending posts",
      "Create 'Disney Adult' specific experiences and marketing - this growing demographic has disposable income and intense brand loyalty but different needs than families",
      "Expand AR experiences in stores and parks - Gen Z expects interactive, phone-integrated experiences that blend digital and physical worlds"
